# Mask Detection /YOLOv7

I've done this project to find out that , when we see a person it will detect the person is with mask or with out mask. It will very helpfull to this current time .It gives higher accuracy in the real time 
world.
I am giving the materials that i've reffered.

First we need to clone official-yolov7 repo, the link is in below
- [ official YOLOv7 ](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7#official-yolov7)
Also here I use the yolov7-x weight for this project

In this project i've use like

- epochs 50
- img size 640
* also i created a new custom_data.yaml,yolov7_custom.yaml files and i uploaded these files in this repo
